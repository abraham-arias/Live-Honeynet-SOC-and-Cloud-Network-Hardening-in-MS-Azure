# Live Honeynet, SOC, and Cloud Network Hardening in MS Azure
![Cloud Honeynet Soc](https://i.imgur.com/I7rzg7l.jpg)

## Introduction

In this project, I created a honeynet in Microsoft Azure and ingested log sources from various resources into a Log Analytics Workspace, which is then used by Microsoft Sentinel to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. Security metrics were measured in the insecure environment for 24 hours, basic security controls were applied to harden the environment, and then the same metrics were re-measured after another 24 hours following the application of the security controls. The sources of those metrics are listed below:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs) - derived from the Windows Virtual Machine and the installed MSSQL Server.
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs) - derived from the Linux Virtual Machine
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet due to configured NSG rules)

The architecture of the honeynet in Azure consisted of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Groups (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

When all the resources were originally deployed, they were very much exposed to the public internet. The Virtual Machines' Network Security Group rules, as well as the VM's built-in firewalls, were manually set to allow all traffic. The other resources were deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet (No Use for Private Endpoints.) Any security incidents, such as unauthenticated (failed) logins, were configured to be ingested by Azure's Log Analytics Workspace (LAW).

## Verified Failed Authentication Logs

A large number of security incidents were generated by Azure Sentinel, most of which were due to malicious attempts to log in to the Windows and Linux VMs, along with the MSSQL Server that was installed on the Windows VM. In Azure, these security incidents can be assigned, investigated and closed out. Investigating the incidents provides more information regarding what occurred and from what IP address(es) the attack originated from. Oftentimes the logs reflected that multiple attempts to log in were made by the same IP's, along with multiple IP addresses related by attack instance and region. The maps shown further below reflect some of those source locations.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics from the insecure environment measured for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-04-27 22:42:41
Stop Time 2023-04-28 22:42:22

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 53,509
| Syslog                   | 5,210
| SecurityAlert            | 7
| SecurityIncident         | 382
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 927

After experiencing the results of the open honeynet, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my workstation(configured by allowing traffic from my IP address only). Public Access was also disabled in the resource-specific firewalls like in the Key Vault. Additionally, Microsoft Defender for Cloud was utilized to implement security controls recommended by NIST and by Microsoft.

## Attack Maps After Hardening / Security Controls

```_All map queries returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening._```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the same metrics for another 24 hours _after_ adding the basic aforementioned security controls to the environment:
Start Time 2023-04-29 15:00:37
Stop Time	2023-04-30 15:00:51

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 10,984
| Syslog                   | 24
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

During this project, a honeynet was set up in Microsoft Azure, and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. The security posture at the onset of the project was very weak, allowing inflows of malicious traffic on any port. Azure's Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinal were utilized to trigger alerts as well as create and investigate incidents based on the ingested logs from the Virtual Machines and the Network Security Groups. In addition, before and after implementing security measures, metrics were measured in the cloud network environment. It is worth mentioning that the effectiveness of the security controls was demonstrated by the significant reduction in the number of security events and incidents. However, if the network's resources were heavily utilized by regular users, there may have been an increase in security events and alerts in the 24 hours following the implementation of the security controls, such as large numbers of users logging in or failing to log in with the correct password. Two final and very interesting points worth mentioning were the sheer quantity of malicious traffic attempting (some succeeding) to gain entry to the cloud environment, and also the various locations that the attacks originated from.
